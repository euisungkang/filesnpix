This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`
- a function that indexes the brightness of each pixel
- a function that averages the brightness of each pixel per line
- a function that loops and calls the previous two functions repeatedly  

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.
- index_pixels, pixel_brightness, index_line
- find_average, get_brightness, line_avg_brightness
- run_brightness, get_brightness, run 

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.
 index_pixels, as it describes the exact act it is doing:
             indexing each pixel. 
find_average, as it is more specific than the other two. Its exact
                   purpose is to average the queue or array or whichever
                   data structure I use. 
run_brightness, as it essentially runs the process that finds the
               average brightness and will eventually return the necessary
               number.  


Function #1:

SEE ABOVE

  Job:
- a function that indexes the brightness of each pixel

  Candidate names:
- index_pixels, pixel_brightness, index_line
  Best name:
index_pixels,
  Why the given name is the best:

as it describes the exact act it is doing: indexing each pixel.



Function #2:

SEE ABOVE 

  Job:

- a function that averages the brightness of each pixel per line,
         after they have been stored by the previous function
  Candidate names:

- find_average, get_brightness, line_avg_brightness
  Best name:
find_average,
  Why the given name is the best:
as it is more specific than the other two. Its exact purpose is
    to average the queue or array or whichever data structure I use.




Function #3:

  Job:

- a function that loops and calls the previous two functions
            repeatedly  

  Candidate names:

- run_brightness, get_brightness, run 
  Best name:
run_brightness,
  Why the given name is the best:
            It essentially runs the process that finds the average
    brightness and will eventually return the necessary number. So 
            the term run seems appropriate.
